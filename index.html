    <p>Hi there! I'm Nicholas Patel, a sophomore computer science student at Purdue University with an insatiable curiosity for all things tech. As an aspiring software developer, I’ve explored everything from programming and software development to graphic design, 3D modeling, video editing, and social media management. If it involves creating something exciting, I’m all in!

Beyond my love for tech, I’m a passionate weightlifter and boxer, an avid sports fan (Go Steelers!), and a thrill-seeking adventurer always on the lookout for new challenges. Recently, my focus has been on developing my very own iOS app—a project that combines my technical skills with my creative drive (and my love for food).

Currently, I’m honing my craft as a software development intern at U.S. Steel, where I’ve been diving deeper into real-world applications of what I love. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore opportunities to grow, learn, and make an impact. Let’s create something amazing together!</p>
